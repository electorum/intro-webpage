this is a project I made for class

I have had experience using HTML before so it wasn't as painful as it could've been, although there's probably some code in there that isn't really used for anything. Sorry about that.

Mainly used resources from GIPHY and w3schools.com, and there is a custom pointer as well (which I gave credit for)

There are interactive elements involved, such buttons to navigate the site and a hover event
